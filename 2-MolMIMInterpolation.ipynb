    "# Interpolating Between Molecules by Manipulating MolMIM Hidden States\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "This notebook assumes that you have the MolMIM NIM available at the following address: `http://molmim:8000`. If your container is available at different address, you will need to modify the URL below.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Molecular interpolation is a technique that enables the creation of novel molecular structures by interpolating between existing molecules. This is achieved by training a generative AI model on a dataset of molecules and then using the model to generate new molecules that are a combination of the characteristics of two or more existing molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of drug discovery, molecular interpolation can be a powerful tool for identifying new potential drug candidates. By interpolating between two molecules that have similar properties but differ in their chemical structure, researchers can generate new molecules that retain the desirable properties of the original molecules while introducing novel features that may enhance their efficacy or reduce their toxicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will be using the MolMIM NIM to interpolate between two JAK inhibitors, momelotinib and gandotinib. JAK inhibitors are a class of molecules that have shown promise in the treatment of various diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders. By interpolating between momelotinib and gandotinib, we can generate new molecules that may combine the beneficial properties of both molecules, such as improved potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will directly manipulate the hidden states of the two JAK inhibtors to generate the interpolated hidden states, then pass these modified hidden states to the model's decoder to translate them back to SMILES strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by importing the necessary libraries."
